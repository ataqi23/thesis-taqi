- Use latex2exp to generate better labelled eigenplots (r_i) 

-Code

- Fix symmetric parameters for RM_stoch, RM_normal, RM_trid
- Fix stochastic parameters for Rm_Erdos
- Write general function for any M \in N yielding the r_xk for all k in evolution_batches

* Evolution Batches
- Analyze the velocity of convergence
- Classify each batch element to the eigenvalues it eventually converges to (or the lack thereof)
- Perform PCA on Stochastic Matrices (Singualar Value Decomposition) and try to leverage isomorphism to random walks on a graph




Consider adding normalized option to matrices.R functions
When we are considering studying eigenmetrics, we should normalize by sqrt(N) to account for increased dimension. (See LecNotes_RMT.pdf)

In matrices_n.R, need to fix stochastic erdos renyi graphs.
instead, do if row_sum = 0, uniformly choose one of the nodes to have probability 1 in order for true stochasticity. 

Also, for the batch simulations, consider creating an option where the batch elements are valid probability distributions (for the stochastic matrices) and ALSO COMPLEX.!!!
