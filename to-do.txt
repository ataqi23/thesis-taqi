-Create a quick batch function so that it gives Q^n / Q^(n-1). This should 
be a fast way to get the eigen_index for an ENSEMBLE of matrices.


- Analyze the quantile plot of the CRS distribution. Use qqplot. Perhaps check it against a location transformed Cauchy plot?

- Writeup a radial density function for spectrum analysis. Perhaps consider enumerating other spectrum statistics: (sup, diff, ...)

- Get the total variational distance computations setup.

- Create some shiny-style app to visualize sliding parameters like: (epsilon, sparsity, matrix size)

- Write a function mixtime_sim_EP that takes a vector of epsilons, appends an epsilon_index column to the batches, and returns a stack of batches for histogram visualization

- When considering log-ratios, take absolute value of the numbers! (last time of ratios_by_time)
