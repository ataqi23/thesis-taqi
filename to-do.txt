- Add a feature to test whether a stochastic matrix represents a recurrent markov chain computationally! (In general, a method to rule out if a matrix satsfies the ergodic conditions. Once done, condition on ergodicity and see if spectra look any different.)

- Adjust spectrum plot aspect ratio to be 1.

- Address the symmetric stochastic matrix absorption dilemma; randomize the diagonal-normalized value of 1's value (give the matrix a larger chance to be recurrent!!)

- Add feature for spectrum to return array with unresolved eigenvalues (components = F?)

- Add RM_"unif, gamma, beta" matrices, etc..

- Update ensemble documentation

- Make sure Github package is working!!

- Beta ensemble spectra

- Write functional analogues of maxim for epsilon, N, and other free parameter type simulations

-Create a quick batch function so that it gives Q^n / Q^(n-1). This should 
be a fast way to get the eigen_index for an ENSEMBLE of matrices.


- Analyze the quantile plot of the CRS distribution. Use qqplot. Perhaps check it against a location transformed Cauchy plot?

- Writeup a radial density function for spectrum analysis. Perhaps consider enumerating other spectrum statistics: (sup, diff, ...)

- Get the total variational distance computations setup.

- Create some shiny-style app to visualize sliding parameters like: (epsilon, sparsity, matrix size)

- Write a function mixtime_sim_EP that takes a vector of epsilons, appends an epsilon_index column to the batches, and returns a stack of batches for histogram visualization

- When considering log-ratios, take absolute value of the numbers! (last time of ratios_by_time)
