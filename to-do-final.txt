- Code Appendix
Fix the issue with page numbering. Either use /includegraphics or figure out a way (using watermarks) ; background package.

As is, \includepdf does not work. The best solution might be to crop the graphics from the code appendix and add the text in tex!

Also, fix runoff comments.

-Appendices (General)
Go through appendices and add paragraphs/expositions.

Fix base case in A.1.2
