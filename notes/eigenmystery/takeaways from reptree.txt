Property III (Relative gaps). The eigenvalues of LDLt in  are divided into subsets
called children according to Step 3 of Algorithm MR3. The purpose of this partition
is to have relative gaps larger than `tol` between the children. 

7. Conclusions
In this paper, we have presented Algorithm MR3 that computes k eigenvectors of
a symmetric tridiagonal in O(kn) time. The salient feature of the proposed algorithm
is that multiple representations LDLt are used, and each eigenvector is computed
to high accuracy with respect to the appropriate representation. No Gramâ€“Schmidt
orthogonalization is needed.

Proving that the computed eigenvectors are numerically orthogonal and have
small residual norms has been a major concern of this paper. Due to the multiple
representations involved the proof is somewhat complicated. The proofs require that
each representation be a relatively robust representation (RRR) for the eigenpairs
that are to be computed using that representation. For the purpose of this paper, we
have assumed that each representation is an RRR. There has been considerable work
in showing the conditions under which RRRs exist, such as in [6,13], however this
is beyond the scope of this paper. In practice, finding appropriate RRRs is easy and
checkable; indeed Algorithm MR3 has been realized as the software routine xSTEGR
that is included in LAPACK [1].
