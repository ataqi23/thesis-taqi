## Abstract

On their own, random variables exude deterministic properties regarding their uncertainty. The same generalization can be made for random matrices, which are matrices whose entries are random variables. One particular statistic worth investigating is the distribution of a matrix ensemble's eigenvalues, or its spectrum. In this thesis, there will be an exploration of various classes of random matrices and relevant spectral statistics like their spectra and mixing times.

## The RMAT package

The RMAT package is a package developed tandem with this thesis. Its primary functionality includes:

- Simulating various random matrices
- Simulating ensembles of these random matrices
- Visualizing the eigenvalue spectra of these matrix ensembles
- Simulating and visualizing mixing time statistics on a random batch of points in a stochastic setting
