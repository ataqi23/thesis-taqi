# Pair schema
# The largest pair scheme; Largest and second largest
# The consecutive-value scheme (Sufficient such that no linear combiantions of the diseprsion metric exists); one apart
# The triangular pair schema (for symmetric dispersion metrics); essentially all the combinations
# The antisymmetric pair scheme (for assymetric dispersion metrics); essentially all the permutations
