# Source Code

A significant portion of this thesis was comprised of simulation in R. As such, these modules were developed for the purposes of this thesis. This source code has been packaged cleanly into a new package called **RMAT**.

The **RMAT** package is composed of two primary modules, the random matrix module `matrices.R` and the spectral statistics module `spectrum.R` and `dispersion.R`. They can be further subdivided into smaller modules as follows.

- Random Matrix Module
  * Explicitly Distributed Matrices
  * Implicitly Distributed Matrices
  * Ensemble Extensions

- Spectral Statistics Module
  * Spectrum
  * Dispersions
  * Parallel Extensions
  * Visualizations
