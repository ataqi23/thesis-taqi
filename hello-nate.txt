Hello Nate!

Consider checking out these documents:

	/code/mixtime_erdos.pdf - In this document, I ran some preliminary simulations of the walks on Erdos -Renyi graph to (finally) look at the effect of the sparsity (p) on the matrix's mixing time. It's currently only a single matrix representing each sparsity level, but as a preliminary, we see sparsity has an positive relationship with mixing time, as we might expect!

	/SIMEV/ratios_normal.pdf - In this document, I simulated some a symmetric normal matrix and ran a simulated random batch. The mixing time distribution is - well - symmetric, seemingly normal-ish. I also plotted the distribution of the ratio norms and the log-transformed version. It seems like the untransformed version is a very Cauchy-looking distribution around the largest eigenvalue. (See reference distribution in the end of the document). Also, I thought it would be interested to look at the variance of the entries at a given power of the matrix (to see the distribution of (aQ^n+1 / aQ^n) at power n. The log version is quite interesting to look at.

	/SIMEV/ratios_stochastic.pdf - In this document, I simulated a regular stochastic matrix and simulated a random batch. Seems like it has a small mixing time. The distribution of ratio norms from the CRS seems like a Cauchy distribution around 1, which is nice! I've put a Cauchy distribution for reference at the end of the document.

Hello Nate!

I’ve refactored my thesis directory (again), but here are some things you should consider looking at!

1) General 
R/matrices.R - I've reconfigured my random matrix code so now it is more user friendly. 

2) Eigenvector Simulation

simulate-ev/methodology.pdf - For my eigenvector simulation process, I've documented some of my methodology that I've already implemented/ will implement. This notation is probably useful for more proper documentation.

R/simulate.R - I've written some methods to help me achieve my goals. So far, I've created code to create a Monte Carlo Batch, and the code to evolve the batch and "push" them towards potential eigenvectors. 

simulate-ev/evolve_eigen.Rmd/.pdf - This is the main document in which I simulate my eigenvectors.

Hello Nate!

I’ve refactored my thesis directory so to save you some time, here are the more interesting files for you to look at:

- matrices.R
- eigenvectors.R
- eigenmetrics.R

- random-matrices.pdf
- sparsity.pdf
- eigenmetrics.pdf
