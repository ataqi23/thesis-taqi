Hello Nate!

Consider checking out these documents:
/code/mixtime.pdf - I ran a very simulation of "mixing times" for a symmetric normal matrix and plotted the distribution of the mixing times. The result is a pleasant surprise!

Hello Nate!

I’ve refactored my thesis directory (again), but here are some things you should consider looking at!

1) General 
R/matrices.R - I've reconfigured my random matrix code so now it is more user friendly. 

2) Eigenvector Simulation

simulate-ev/methodology.pdf - For my eigenvector simulation process, I've documented some of my methodology that I've already implemented/ will implement. This notation is probably useful for more proper documentation.

R/simulate.R - I've written some methods to help me achieve my goals. So far, I've created code to create a Monte Carlo Batch, and the code to evolve the batch and "push" them towards potential eigenvectors. 

simulate-ev/evolve_eigen.Rmd/.pdf - This is the main document in which I simulate my eigenvectors.

Hello Nate!

I’ve refactored my thesis directory so to save you some time, here are the more interesting files for you to look at:

- matrices.R
- eigenvectors.R
- eigenmetrics.R

- random-matrices.pdf
- sparsity.pdf
- eigenmetrics.pdf
