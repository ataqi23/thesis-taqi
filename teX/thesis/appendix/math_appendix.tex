\begin{definition}[Random Variable]
A random variable $X: \Omega \to \R$ is a function from some sample space $\Omega = \{s_i\}_{i=1}^n$ to the real numbers $\R$. The sample space is taken to be any set of events such that the probability function corrosponding to the random variable, $p_X$ exhausts over all the events in $\Omega$. In other words, we expect $\int_\Omega p_X(s) = 1$.
