\chapter{Algorithm Appendix}

In this appendix, we will enumerate the various algorithms used in this thesis for the purpose of transparency and reproducibility. Every one of these algorithms have their code counterpart in the $\RMAT$ package. For the most part, the implicit $\D$-matrices are the non-trivial algorithms to peruse. Changing methodology could impact results, and as such, all results are tied to the algorithms in this appendix.

Note that for Erdos-Renyi transition matrices, we cannot set the degree of the vertex to be $0$.
Otherwise, the matrix cannot be stochastic. As such, we sever $N - 1$ vertices \textbf{at most}.
This means that these matrices do not formally represent walks on Erdos-Renyi graphs, but rather an extremely close approximation of them.
