\chapter{Algorithm Appendix}

In this appendix, we will enumerate the various algorithms used in this thesis for the purpose of transparency and reproducibility. Every one of these algorithms have their code counterpart in the $\RMAT$ package. For the most part, the implicit $\D$-matrices are the non-trivial algorithms to peruse. Changing methodology could impact results, and as such, all results are tied to the algorithms in this appendix.
