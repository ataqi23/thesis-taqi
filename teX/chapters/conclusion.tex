%The \introduction command is provided as a convenience.
%if you want special chapter formatting, you'll probably want to avoid using it altogether

  \chapter*{Conclusion}
       \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Conclusion}
\chaptermark{Conclusion}
\markboth{Conclusion}{Conclusion}

	% The three lines above are to make sure that the headers are right, that the intro gets included in the table of contents, and that it doesn't get numbered 1 so that chapter one is 1.

WE DID IT!!!!!!!!
