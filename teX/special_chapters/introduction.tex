So, what are \textit{spectral statistics}? Do they have to do with rainbows? Sceptres? No, they don’t, but they’re almost as colorful and regal. The word spectral is borrowed from the spectral-like patterns observed in statistical physics - whether it may be atomic spectra or other quantum mechanical phenomena. The borrowing is loose and not literal, but still somewhat well founded. 

The field of Random Matrix Theory was extensively developed in the 1930s by the nuclear physicist Eugene Wigner. He found connections between the deterministic properties of atomic nuclei and their random and stochastic behaviors. The link? Random matrices.

So in the context of this thesis, \textit{Spectral statistics} will be an umbrella term for random matrix statistics that somehow involve that matrix's eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
