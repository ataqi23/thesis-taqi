			THESIS LOG
========================================================
Monday, February 8th
Today we discussed various topics. We discussed the ratio distribution that we saw, and there is a chance this might be some ratio distribution of chi-squared variables. We also were tinkering and exploring the mixing time statistics and were reasoning through why similar-signed matrices tended to converge faster. The takeaways are, I should continue exploring and organizing data for these computations for large-scale analysis. Lastly, we ended on the note that we will be discussing beta ensembles next meeting!

	Today I just caught up with Nate since we just returned from Winter Break. We just chatted about the formatting of thesis in TeX and how to deal with chapters and \include functions. Also, we talked about workflow and Nate suggested I use .Rproj files and Github projects. The .Rproj files serve as localized R environments that don't delete! Great for simulations that take a long time and don't need to be accessed frequently.
	Also, we caught up on my simulations. I showed Nate the histograms of the ratio data from the simulations. Nate suggested I take the log and see how they are distributed. As it stands, it seems that they are distributed around the largest eigenvalue of the matrix. Here are a few things to do.
(To Do):
-See the log of the distribution.
-Instead of fixing the matrix, try fixing the point and observing the ensemble behavior of it.
-Try messing with the standard deviation of the normal matrices and see how that changes things.
