Currently, the thesis loosely focuses on "Spectral Statistics of Random Matrices". To narrow down our focus, this document will outline and organize the potential avenues of focus.

## Stochastic Matrices

Stochastic matrices are ergodic if they have a limiting distribution that is also the stationary distribution. This is achieved when the matrix represents a Markov chain that is aperiodic and irreducible. 

- Does anything change when the matrix is symmetric?

## Erdos-Renyi Graphs

Walks on an ERG represent a parameterizable class of stochastic matrices. Specifically, we can parameterize its sparsity or connectedness with a parameter $p$. We wish to study the following:

- How does $p$ impact the mixing time of the related Markov Chain?
- How does $p$ impact the spectrum of the related matrix ensemble?

## Normal Matrices

For normal matrices, we study a hidden markov chain in the CRS. For this, we also ask:

- How do the parameters of the ensemble affect mixing time?
- What properties exist in the entries of the CRS? Are there any gurantees with normal matrices?
- Does anything change when the matrix is symmetric?

## Band Matrices

- What about band matrices? (e.g. tridiagonal normal)
