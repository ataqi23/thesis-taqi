## Possible Distributions

Recall that we are considering the entries of the consecutive ratio sequence. One possible distribution of these entries is a Cauchy distribution.

A $\text{Cauchy}(x_0, \gamma)$ distribution has the following:

PDF: $\frac{1}{\pi\gamma \left[1+\left(\frac{x-x_0}{\gamma}\right)^2\right]}$ \newline
Median: $x_0$ \newline
Mean: Undefined \newline
Variance: Undefined \newline


A $\text{Log-Cauchy}(\mu, \sigma)$ distribution has the following:

PDF: $\frac{1}{\pi x}\left[\frac{\sigma}{\ln(x - \mu)^2 + \sigma^2}\right]$ \newline
Median: $e^\mu$ \newline
Mean: $\infty$ \newline
Variance: $\infty$ \newline

## Variance by Power

Additionally, we also consider the plots of the variance of the CRS by a given time. In clearer terms, we also consider the following:

$$V(n) = \text{Var}\left(\frac{\vec{a}Q^{n+1}}{\vec{a}Q^n}\right) \text{ for } \vec{a} = (a_i) \text{ where } a_i \sim \text{Unif}(-\lambda,\lambda)$$
