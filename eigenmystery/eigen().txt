LAPACK::DSYEVR

-DSYEVR computes selected eigenvalues and, optionally, eigenvectors
 of a real symmetric matrix A.  Eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be
 selected by specifying either a range of values or a range of
 indices for the desired eigenvalues.

 DSYEVR first reduces the matrix A to tridiagonal form T with a call
 to DSYTRD.  Then, whenever possible, DSYEVR calls DSTEMR to compute
 the eigenspectrum using Relatively Robust Representations.  DSTEMR
 computes eigenvalues by the dqds algorithm, while orthogonal
 eigenvectors are computed from various "good" L D L^T representations
 (also known as Relatively Robust Representations). Gram-Schmidt
 orthogonalization is avoided as far as possible. More specifically,
 the various steps of the algorithm are as follows.

 For each unreduced block (submatrix) of T,
    (a) Compute T - sigma I  = L D L^T, so that L and D
        define all the wanted eigenvalues to high relative accuracy.
        This means that small relative changes in the entries of D and L
        cause only small relative changes in the eigenvalues and
        eigenvectors. The standard (unfactored) representation of the
        tridiagonal matrix T does not have this property in general.
    (b) Compute the eigenvalues to suitable accuracy.
        If the eigenvectors are desired, the algorithm attains full
        accuracy of the computed eigenvalues only right before
        the corresponding vectors have to be computed, see steps c) and d).
    (c) For each cluster of close eigenvalues, select a new
        shift close to the cluster, find a new factorization, and refine
        the shifted eigenvalues to suitable accuracy.
    (d) For each eigenvalue with a large enough relative separation compute
        the corresponding eigenvector by forming a rank revealing twisted
        factorization. Go back to (c) for any clusters that remain.

 The desired accuracy of the output can be specified by the input
 parameter ABSTOL.

 Note 1 : DSYEVR calls DSTEMR when the full spectrum is requested
 on machines which conform to the ieee-754 floating point standard.
 DSYEVR calls DSTEBZ and DSTEIN on non-ieee machines and
 when partial spectrum requests are made.

 Normal execution of DSTEMR may create NaNs and infinities and
 hence may abort due to a floating point exception in environments
 which do not handle NaNs and infinities in the ieee standard default
 manner.
